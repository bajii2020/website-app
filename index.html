        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p class="para">My name is Bahja (Coding bee in the coding world), I live in London, and I am aspiring to become a
            Software Engineer. 
            I have two family cats, I've added a photo of them on them above.
            I love movies! A hobby of mine is to watch movies, films and tv series. 
            The main platform I use to watch movies is Netflix. I also use Disney+ to watch movies. Disney plus is my go-to place for marvel movies :)
            I'm would call myself a Marvel fan.
            I have listed my top 5 marvel movies below. Have a read :)</p>
        
            <h3>Why Software Engineering:</h3>
            <p class="para">I want to become a Software Engineer because I want to build software for a living, software that would be used to make a change in people’s lives. 
            For the past couple of months, I have been working on my coding skills building websites like this one! 
            I’ve worked on my HTML, CSS and JavaScript making me comfortable enough to programme small projects from scratch. 
            I am not great at this however I am determined to learn and grow from here.
            I‘ve used my website to showcase some of my work and also to introduce myself and what I like!</p>
